# Map-Sea-Level-Rise-South-Miami-Beach
Map of rising sea levels in the year 2100 using information from IPCC.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). If emission outputs are maintained (RCP8.6) then by the year 2100 sea levels could rise 1.1 meters [1]. However, if levels are reduced (RCP2.6) then by 2100 sea levels may only rise 0.6 meters [1]. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) represent emission concentrations [2].

RCP2.6 - Strongly Declining Emissions
RCP8.5 - Increasing Emissions.

The difference of 0.5 meters between RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 outcomes may not seem drastic. However for low elevation coastal cities the difference between 0.6 meters and 1.1 meters could mean everything.

In this small project I looked at the southern tip of Miami Beach Florida. Known for it's beautiful soft sand, it is also one of the many coastal communities at risk of rising sea level. The produced map shows the land effected by both RCP2.6, and RCP8.5 outcomes.
